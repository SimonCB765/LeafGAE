		<h2>PDB Subset Culling</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Only one of pasting chains/entries to cull, selecting an organism to cull from, entering an organism 
					to cull from or uploading a file of chains/entries to cull is permitted.
				</li>
				<li>
					The organism entry is case insensitive, but the name entered must match exactly that used by the PDB.
				</li>
				<li>Any file uploaded should be in plain text format. For example, do not create and submit a Microsoft Word format file.</li>
				<li>The expected format for the pasted/uploaded PDB chains/entries to cull is to have one chain/entry on a line with no additional whitesapce on the line.</li>
				<li>
					When culling the PDB by chains, it is acceptable to supply entries. The entries will just be converted into all their constituent chains 
					for the culling. For example, if culling by chain and you supply the entry 4FCV, then this will be converted to 4FCVA, 4FCVB and 4FCVC.
				</li>
				<li>
					The percentage sequence identity submitted will be taken to be the maximum sequence identity permissible. 
					For example, if 20% sequence identity is chosen, there will be no chains/entries with greater than 20% 
					sequence identity in the non-redundant set. The percentage must be greater than or equal to 5, and less than 100.
				</li>
				<li>
					The minimum and maximum resolution are used to ensure that all chains/entries in the non-redundant dataset 
					have a resolution within the user specified range. The permissible range of values for the minimum and maximum resolution is 0-100. 
					The minimum resolution can not be greater than the maximum.
				</li>
				<li>
					The maximum R value is used to ensure that all chains/entries in the non-redundant dataset have an R value 
					no greater than the maximum specified. The permissible range of values for the R value is 0-1.
				</li>
				<li>
					If skip non-X-ray entries is chosen, then only those chains/entries that have X-ray diffraction recorded  
					as their experimental type will be present in the non-redundant dataset.
				</li>
				<li>
					If skip alpha carbon only entries is chosen, then chains/entries that only have alpha carbon atoms will 
					not be present in the non-redundant dataset.
				</li>
				<li>
					The two methods of culling the PDB are 'by chain' and 'by entry'. Please see 
					<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1160163/">PISCES</a> for a description of the 
					differences between the two methods.
				</li>
				<li>
					The within entry percentage sequence identity is used when culling chains within entries. A value of 20% 
					will ensure that no two chains from the same entry with greater than 20% sequence identity are kept in 
					the non-redundant dataset. Within entry culling is performed only if 'by entry' culling is selected. 
					Please see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1160163/">PISCES</a> for a description 
					of the within entry culling. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The minimum and maximum lengths are optional, and are used to ensure that no sequences have fewer amino 
					acids than the minimum length provided or more amino acids than the maximum length provided. If both a 
					minimum and a maximum are specified, then the maximum can not be less than the minimum.

		<p>
			See <b><a href="{{ url_for('help') }}#DataCollection">here</a></b> for more information about the extraction of the data from the PDB, experimental abbreviations, etc.<br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					PDB Results
					<ul>
						<li>
							User Input<!-- (not present if culling from the whole PDB was performed)-->
							<ul>
								<li>A list of the chains/entries submitted by the user, with one chain/entry on each line.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Input Sequences Removed

					<ul>
						<li>
							Non-redundant Sequence Statistics
							<ul>
								<li>A table of information about the non-redundant chains/entries submitted by the user.</li>
								<li>Each line contains six values separated by tabs ('\t').</li>
								<li>
									The values (from left to right) are as follows: the name of the chain/entry, the length (in amino acids) of the chain/entry (the length of an entry is the length of a random chain in the entry), 
									the abbreviation for the experimental method used to determine the structure, the resolution of the structure, the R-value and the free R-value.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Non-redundant Sequences
							<ul>
								<li>A FASTA format file of the chains in the non-redundant dataset.</li>
								<li>If cull by entry was selected, then this file contains all the chains in each non-redundant entry that were not removed by intra-entry culling of chains.</li>
								<li>Each chain is represented by two consecutive lines in the file.</li>
								<li>The first line is an identifier line for the chain. The second line contains the sequence of the chain.</li>
								<li>
									The identifier line begins with a '>', and the values (from left to right) are: Chain ID, 
									Chain Length, Experimental Method Abbreviation, Resolution, R-value, Free R-value, Alpha Carbon Only, Chain Description, &#60DBCode DBIdentifier&#62 and [OrganismName].
								</li>
								<li>Tabs separate the values on the identifier line.</li>
								<li>There may be additional whitespace in the Chain Description.</li>
								<li>Alpha Carbon Only is 'no' if the chain structure is not purely composed of alpha carbon atoms.</li>
								<li>
									The DBCode is the code used by the PDB to record an external database where information about the chain can be found (e.g. UNP for UniProt), and the 
									DBIdentifier is the identifier used to locate the chain in the external database (e.g. VAV_MOUSE).
								</li>
								<li>
									The OrganismName is case insensitive, and appears exactly as it was recorded in the PDB (e.g. Mus musculus and MUS MUSCULUS may both appear). It always
									consists of the genus and species of the organism separated by a space.

					If 50% or more of the amino acids in an amino acid sequence are X (the amino acid code for unknown), then the entity is marked as a NonProtein, 
					and not included in the list of proteins.
				</li>
				<li>
					When determining the value for the resolution:<br>
					Only one of the _refine and _reflns records is used (with preference given to the _refine record).<br>
					If there is no value present for the resolution, then the resolution is set to 100.<br>
					Similariy if there is no value present for the R-value or the R-free value, then these values are set to 1.

				<li>
					When determining the organism which the entity originates from:<br>
					Only one of _entity_src_gen, _entity_src_nat or _pdbx_entity_src_syn is used (with preference given in the order _entity_src_nat, _entity_src_gen and finally _pdbx_entity_src_syn).
